# Project One: Nom' Stop. A Food App For The Picky Millennial. 

We are the Wizards of Git and we wanted to create an app to simplify the life of people. Who hasn't been in the situation where you need to get dinner but you don’t know where to go ? when you've tried all the restaurants in your neighborhood and end up ordering from the same place over and over again. That's why we created “nom’stop”, the app that chooses for you and makes choosing dinner easy!

## User Story

As an indecisive individual who loves trying out new foods, I want an app that will choose a restaurant for me so that I don’t have to decide. Being surrounded by a variety of options, doesn’t make choosing one easy. Our motivation was to alleviate the frustration especially for couples and small groups when it comes to deciding where to eat.

## Features

The goal in mind when build the app was simplistic responsiveness. We wanted an app that was easy to use, yet was dynamic enough to conform to use anywhere.
Simply input what type of cuisine you want to eat, how much you want to pay, and your location and the app will populate a randomized result. do the rest! You will be given a result and will be able to see the restaurant's information, rating, location, phone, etc. And if that doesn’t help, our app has a randomizer function that will randomly select a restaurant for you to dine at.

###### Current Features

* Filter Selectors based Cuisine, Price Range and Radius which dependent on user location.
* A randomizer to take a pool of results, pick one and present it to the user.
* A Map to display the location of the resulting restaurant

###### Future Implementations

* Return multiple restaurants to user
* Local Deals
* Randomizer for filters if the user is feeling adventurous.
* Sign up feature so that the user has the ability to create an account
* Voting feature 
* Dating app integration
